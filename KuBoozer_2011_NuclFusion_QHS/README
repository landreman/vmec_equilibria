The configurations n4qh.b4.a79a and n5qh.fx3.a55z were obtained in an email from Neil Pomphrey on Jan 14 2019. Here is the text of his email:

I have attached a couple of input files - input.n4qh.b4.a79a (A=8, np = 4) and
input.n5qh.fx3.a55z (A=5, np = 10) from Long-Poe's directories that may be from that paper. I AM NOT 100% SURE THEY ARE THE
ONES REFERRED TO IN THE PAPER so you should reconstruct the equilibria, eps_eff and modB plots to see if they agree with the plots in the paper.
