The configurations n4qh.b4.a79a and n5qh.fx3.a55z were obtained in an email from Neil Pomphrey on Jan 14 2019. Here is the text of his email:

I have attached a couple of input files - input.n4qh.b4.a79a (A=8, np = 4) and
input.n5qh.fx3.a55z (A=5, np = 10) from Long-Poe's directories that may be from that paper. I AM NOT 100% SURE THEY ARE THE
ONES REFERRED TO IN THE PAPER so you should reconstruct the equilibria, eps_eff and modB plots to see if they agree with the plots in the paper.

My email to Neil from Jan 14 2019:

Hi Neil,
I confirmed with multiple checks that input.n4qh.b4.a79a is the configuration from section 2 of Ku's paper. The Garabedian coefficients match those reported in the paper, the pressure and iota profiles match, and the B_mn's match fig 6. It seems that input.n5qh.fx3.a55z is very similar to the configuration at the start of section 3, but the Garabedian coefficients and iota values differ a little bit, e.g. Delta_{1,1} = 0.562 vs 0.588. The first configuration (n4qh.b4.a79a) is sufficient for my present study. If you happen to see a file that might be the 'true' section 3 configuration, let me know - it would be nice to have so the information is not lost.
Best,
Matt
